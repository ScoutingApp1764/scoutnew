This is the 2016 1764 Scoutting App repository. It uses a >3.0 version of Tkinter and python2. 

Complain to the macbook managers for using the old libraries and programming languages, they maintain this stuff.

Variable naming:

<abrievatedSubject><Tkinterclassabrev>

ex: autoLabel
For the autonomous label.

For non-tkinter stuff, just make a 2-3 word named casedLikeThis.
